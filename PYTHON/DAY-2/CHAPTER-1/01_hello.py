And the dog is divided. For a moment he turns
his bloodshot eyes to the sky. Then his gaze
drops to the road again. In dust up to his armpits

comes a toothless man who likes to tease.
As usual today he shoves a stick between
the rails whistles mocks shouts. The dog stays
put howls without hope. The man searches

for a stone. The hens shriek for. The ducks groan
against. The stone hits the air misses the mark
and lands among the squabblers. The toothless guy
leaves the dog for dead. Blood squeezes his head.''')
